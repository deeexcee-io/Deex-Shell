# Deex-Shell
Interactive Python Program that creates a Windows Executable which utilises an Obfuscated PowerShell One Liner to get a reverse shell. 
## Update
10/03/2025 - Was getting blocked by Defender. Not anymore ðŸ¤¡

# C#/PowerShell Reverse Shell Executable
Currently Undetected (Defender) Executable Reverse Shell Windows PE. 

The program generates a unique, obfuscated Powershell Reverse Shell One Liner each time.
The One Liner is then utilised in the executable which executes the obfuscated Powershell Reverse Shell when ran. 

The C# code and PowerShell Script are dynamically generated each time so no 2 files should be the same, even with the same IP Address and Port.
```python
[+] Enter 1 to Create PE and start Listeners
[+] Enter 2 to simply create a PE
[+] Enter 3 to simply create a Obfuscated PowerShell Reverse Shell One Liner


<--Deex--># : 2
Enter IP address: 192.168.227.128
Enter port: 55555
[+] PE has been saved as CHIoWmocNR.exe and Remote PowerShell Reverse Shell Script has been saved as maDWQUYjzg in the current directory
Returning to Main Menu....

[+] Enter 1 to Create PE and start Listeners

Perfect for CTF or Pen Testing purposes if Defender is running. 

Any and all feedback is appreciated. 

## Pre-requisites

It uses mono to compile the C# code in the python script into an executable so must be installed prior to running the script. 

On Kali
```
sudo apt install mono-mcs

sudo apt install mono-devel
```

Then simply run 
```
python3 deex-shell.py
```
## Option 1

Creates an Obfuscated and currently undetected (Defender) PowerShell Reverse Shell Script and PE. The program then launches a HTTP server to host the PowerShell Script which the executable grabs during execution. A netcat listener is then setup which catches the shell. 

## Option 2

Outputs the PE and PowerShell Script to host to allow you to excute when needed.

## Option 3 

Outputs the Obfuscated PowerShell Script only

Currently undetectable but behavioural detections can class it as "malicious". What I mean by that is if the executable is transferred over and then executed immediatley, the fact it reaches out to a remote address and calls PowerShell is suspicious.
