# Deex-Shell
Interactive Python Program that creates a Windows Executable which utilises an Obfuscated PowerShell One Liner to get a reverse shell. 

# C#/PowerShell Reverse Shell Executable
Currently Undetected Executable Reverse Shell Windows PE. 

The program generates a unique, obfuscated Powershell Reverse Shell One Liner each time.
The One Liner is then utilised in the executable which executes the obfuscated Powershell Reverse Shell when ran. 

The C# code and PowerShell Script are dynamically generated each time so no 2 files should be the same, even with the same IP Address and Port.
```python
[+] Enter 1 to Create PE and start Listeners
[+] Enter 2 to simply create a PE
[+] Enter 3 to simply create a Obfuscated PowerShell Reverse Shell One Liner


<--Deex--># : 2
Enter IP address: 192.168.227.128
Enter port: 55555
[+] PE has been saved as CHIoWmocNR.exe and Remote PowerShell Reverse Shell Script has been saved as maDWQUYjzg in the current directory

Perfect for CTF or Pen Testing purposes if Defender is running. 

# Motivation 

Back when I was learning Pen Testing, it was fun. Smashing boxes and exploiting issues with Reverse/Meterpreter Shells raining down upon you. But AV was never a consideration. Enter the real world and any decent AV will shutdown script kiddie tactics, kill a reverse shell and ruin your day. I wanted, or accurately needed something I could use as a PoC when testing and for reporting purposes. Having not enough knowledge of the windows sysinternals and coding in C or C# to make one from scratch, I took what I did know enough of i.e bash, python, powershell, some C# and a healthy dose of asking chatgpt questions, I mixed it all together and created this. It's clunky, it's not stealthy, but if you need to execute an .exe to get a shell and bypass AV (Only tested on Defender), then this works quite well. 

Any and all feedback is appreciated. 

## Pre-requisites

It uses mono to compile the C# code in the python script into an executable so must be installed prior to running the script. 

On Kali
```
sudo apt install mono-mcs

sudo apt install mono-devel
```

Then simply run 
```
python3 deex-shell.py
```
## Option 1

Creates an Obfuscated and currently undetected (Defender) PowerShell Reverse Shell Script and PE. The program then launches a HTTP server to host the PowerShell Script which the executable grabs during execution. A netcat listener is then setup which catches the shell. 

## Option 2

Outputs the PE and PowerShell Script to host to allow you to excute when needed.

## Option 3 

Outputs the Obfuscated PowerShell Script only

Currently undetectable but behavioural detections can class it as "malicious". What I mean by that is if the executable is transferred over and then executed immediatley, the fact it reaches out to a remote address and calls PowerShell is suspicious.
